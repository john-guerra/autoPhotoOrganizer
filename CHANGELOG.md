# Changelog

Notable changes to AutoGallery, newest first. Versions follow the scheme in
`CLAUDE.md` (§ Versioning): each fixed issue bumps `package.json` by the change's
gravity, keeping the `-alpha` suffix until a stable release is cut. Entries are
short and user-facing — what you can now do, not how it's built.

## 2.2.0-alpha

- **Open a folder** — focus the whole app (feed, tree, counts, albums) on a
  single folder and its subfolders, while the library total stays unscoped
  (#66).

## 2.1.0-alpha

- **Keyboard shortcuts overlay** — press `?` (or the topbar `?` button) to see
  every shortcut, grouped by grid and loupe (#26).
- **App version in the title** — the browser tab / Electron window title and the
  topbar now show the running version.

## 2.0.0-alpha

- **Reveal in Finder** — right-click a photo to open its real location in the OS
  file browser (#18).
- **Dev server picks a free port** — `npm run dev` no longer crashes when 4321
  is busy, and the packaged app no longer squats the dev port (#65).
- Initial v2 alpha: local-first triage — fast folder scan, justified virtualized
  grid, keyboard-first star rating, loupe with prefetch, time-gap album
  clustering, and Electron packaging.
